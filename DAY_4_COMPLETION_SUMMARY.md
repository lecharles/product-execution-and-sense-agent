- **Status Display**: Clear session state (active, paused, completed)

### Progress Tracking
- **Completion Percentage**: Real-time progress calculation
- **Question Navigation**: Click-to-jump between questions
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded question status
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Completed/current/remaining counts

### History Management
- **Automatic Saving**: Sessions saved to localStorage on completion

- Memory-efficient timer implementations

## ⚠️ Technical Notes

### State Management
All session data flows through the Zustand store with proper immutable updates. LocalStorage operations are batched to prevent performance issues.

### Time Handling
Uses Date objects and Math.floor for precise timing calculations. All time formatting accounts for edge cases like hours vs minutes display.

### Data Persistence
Session history persists in localStorage with automatic cleanup. Export functionality creates downloadable JSON with complete session metadata.
